## The Philosophy

I travel to slow down, not to check boxes. Train journeys over flights. Small towns over capitals. One cafe twice instead of ten cafes once.

## Routes That Work

- Slow rail through Europe (Swiss trains, Italian slowness)
- Walking between villages in the Alps
- Following rivers instead of highways
- Staying put for a week minimum

## Favorite Finds

The best discoveries are never in guidebooks. They're the secondhand bookshop run by someone who's lived there 30 years, or the small restaurant where locals eat lunch, or the hidden viewpoint that takes one wrong turn to find.

Travel is about meeting quiet, not escaping.
