## The Route

Took the train south with a camera and a small notebook. I kept notes about routes, station cafes, and short hikes between stops.

The best part of the trip was having time to look out the window without a schedule. Next time, I want to rent bikes and follow the shoreline paths near Como.

## Where to Stop

- **Zurich**: Morning coffee at Sprüngli, browse bookshops
- **Lugano**: Afternoon by the lake, climb the nearby hills
- **Como**: Sunset walks along the waterfront

Each stop was about slowing down, not rushing through.
