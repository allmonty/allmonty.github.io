summary: "My first post of the year, reflecting on the last year's adventures."

In 2025, I started exploring various hobbies and personal projects. I exhibited my photography online, bought analog and digital cameras, created an app for image filters, learned to play the trumpet, much more. I'll write a detailed post about all these adventures soon, but for now I wanted to share that I've decided to revive this personal website.

I decided to update this site after taking a closer look at a college friend's website, [Vinizinho.net](https://vinizinho.net/), which I found very interesting and made me think about leaving my own mark on the internet too.

Well, this is the first post of the year! May 2026 be an amazing year for all of us!

I'm sharing some photos I took recently. I'll be back soon with more posts!
