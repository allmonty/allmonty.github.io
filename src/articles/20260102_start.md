summary: "My first post of the year, reflecting on the last year's adventures."

In 2025 I threw myself into a bunch of personal projects: I exhibited my photography, picked up both analog and digital cameras, built a small app for image filters, learned to play the trumpet, and explored a lot of other creative experiments. I’ll share a longer write-up about these adventures soon, but for now I’m reviving this site to collect and publish the work as it happens.

A college friend’s site, [Vinizinho.net](https://vinizinho.net/), was the nudge I needed — seeing his thoughtful, personal corner of the web inspired me to leave my own mark online.

This is the first post of the year. Here are a few recent photos I’m excited to share — I’ll be back with more stories and updates soon. May 2026 bring great things for all of us!
