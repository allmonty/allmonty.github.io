## On the Hunt

Photography for me is about catching light before it changes. Early mornings in cities, late afternoons on trails—those are the hours when the world looks the most honest.

## What I Look For

- Shadows that tell a story
- Quiet moments between crowds
- Colors that clash and work at once
- People lost in thought

## Recent Wandering

Mostly shooting 35mm film now. It slows everything down. You think harder before you press the shutter. The grain reminds me that imperfection is the point.
