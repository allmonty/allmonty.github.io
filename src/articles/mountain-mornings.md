## The Golden Hour

Early light changes everything. These shots were taken between 6 and 8 AM, when the world is still quiet and the sun hits at angles that make ordinary scenes feel extraordinary.

## By the Water

Lakeside towns at dawn have a stillness you won't find later in the day. The reflections are perfect mirrors, and there's usually no one around but locals with coffee.

## Small Details

Sometimes the best shots aren't wide landscapes. A fence line, a boat, a lone tree—these simple elements tell stories when the light is right.

Each of these was taken with an old Pentax K1000 and Kodak Portra 400. Film forces you to slow down and think about each frame.
