## Why Write

Writing clarifies thinking. When you try to explain an idea clearly, you find the holes in it. So I write to learn, not to teach.

## What I'm Learning

- Building small tools that do one thing well
- React patterns for maintainability
- How to write design systems that breathe
- Saying no to features

## The Weekend Projects

Those small sketches—prototypes, UI experiments, tiny scripts—are where the real learning happens. They live in notebooks, GitHub gists, and sometimes here.

Every project teaches something about constraint, clarity, and why simplicity is the hardest thing to achieve.
