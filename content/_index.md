I am a full-stack software engineer well versed in functional and object-oriented languages. I have a great interest in projects that impact many people. I have developed systems for a bank with more than 40 million customers that processed millions of requests per day with trust and stability.

I work better in teams with a high sense of collaboration, where people like to work in pairs, share knowledge, and everyone can collaborate with ideas on what is developed.

In my most recent professional experiences, I worked with microservices in Clojure, Elixir, Python, and in mobile with Flutter.
